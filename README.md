# ghiOS7

A [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org) ready theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) inspired by iOS7 look.

To set up google+, disqus or facebook comments is enough to open posts.hbs, uncomment the appropriate section at the end of the file and add the appropriate variables.

Some screenshots are available here:
